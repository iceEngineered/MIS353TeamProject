# MIS353TeamProject

When brainstorming our project direction, we essentially combined all of our ideas together into 1 project that documents the 60 day forecast, recent natural disasters in relevent cities across America, and the difference in the projected forecast vs how the weather actually was that day. We are setting this website up to be a good reasource for homeowners to determine the average weather in their reigion, accuracy of said forecast in that region, as well as giving insight through documentation on the frequency of natural disasters in the current area to determine whether or not it is a safe area to live.

We seperated the six stored procedures by two per person based off of their original idea.

Skylar's two SPs

-Adding weather data for months > 6
-Pull 6-month weather forecasts

Curtis' two SPs

-Updating natural disaster info
-Pull natural disaster history

Philip's two SPs

-forecasts vs actual
-creating new data for “forecasts vs actual”

We used wunderground.com and Wikipedia's list of natural disasters in the United States at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_in_the_United_States. We did not use ChatGPT to create any of the code used.
